Hello and welcome to FindMyTD's static hosting server, named after [Countess Markievicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Markievicz "Constance Markievicz Wikipedia Page") - the first female cabinet Minister in Europe. 

Here, we store images of TD's and Senators, bits of CSS and other cool backend craic.  

## Tips

 Insert `%27` in the image URL when there is an apostrophe in the name.
 
 Go to [oireachtas.ie](https://www.oireachtas.ie "Houses of the Oireachtas") when there are f√°das in the name. Get their profile URL and copy.
