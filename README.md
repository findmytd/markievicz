Hello and welcome to FindMyTD's static hosting server, named after [Countess Markievicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Markievicz "Constance Markievicz Wikipedia Page") - the first female cabinet Minister in Europe. 

Here, we store images of TD's and Senators, bits of CSS and other bits and bobs.  

## Notes

Images of TD’s and Senators, unless otherwise stated, are courtesy of the Houses of the Oireachtas and are licensed under the [Oireachtas (Open Data) PSI Licence](https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/corporate/governanceAndReform/2016/2016-03-27_oireachtas-psi-licence-open-data_en.pdf). For licensing simplicity, we only use pictures of TD's/Senators from the Houses of the Oireachtas. Pull requests with images from another source **will not** be accepted. 

## Tips

 Insert `%27` in the image URL when there is an apostrophe in the name.
 
 Go to [oireachtas.ie](https://www.oireachtas.ie "Houses of the Oireachtas") when there are fádas in the name. Get their profile URL and copy.
